achieve optimal coverage with:
    enable battery usage -> background activity
    enable battery usage -> allow auto-launch
    manage notifications -> allow notifications when do not disturb is on
    disable remove permissions if app isn't used / disable pause activity if app isn't used
    enable background data

notification behaviour:
    silent notifications mutes it completely
    do not disturb mutes it if alarm only, but not if important only
    sometimes takes a while to receive FCM
    sometimes does not play sound when not muted but app is closed

// Permissions that have to be requested:
// Permission.ignoreBatteryOptimizations
// Permission.scheduleExactAlarm
// Permission.notification
// Permission.locationWhenInUse (optional) AFTER THAT Permission.locationAlways (optional)

NOTES:
- when phone off and then unlocked, ALWAYS directly opens the app and navigates
- background and terminated has identical behaviour
- sound & notification ALWAYS working (still uses notification sound though)
- sound instantly turns off when pulling down notification screen
